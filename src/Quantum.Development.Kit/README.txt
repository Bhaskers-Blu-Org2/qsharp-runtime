The content of this folder is deprecated and only preserved to support both the old and the new setup for some extended period of time. 

Important: This deprecated version of the Microsoft.Quantum.Development.Kit package clashes with the Microsoft.Quantum.Sdk, meaning that projects which use the new Sdk should *not* include this package. 
Eventually, we will likely adapt the Microsoft.Quantum.Development.Kit package to no longer provide the build functionality it currently does, but instead merely aggregate a collection of packages. 
At that point the package will be again compatible with the Sdk, and the Sdk will become required to compile Q# projects.
